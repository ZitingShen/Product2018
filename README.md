Product2018
===========
Product 2018 is a question similar to the IVXLCDM problem in http://www.alethis.net/amusements/curiosities/roman.html. We try to get numbers using the figures 2, 0, 1 and 8, and the operation including adding, subtracting, timing, dividing, combining, adding a decimal point, exponential operation, square root operation, factorial operation, etc.

BM suggested I should use the shunting yard algorithm in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm.

The project has not been finished yet and actually got stuck recently. The biggest problem now is that I find I have to deal with parentheses which make the problem complicated.
